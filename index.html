  <p>&emsp;“My Mates” is a new application targeting small groups of people with the need to communicate with each other in absolute secrecy. Some unique capabilities include:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>&emsp;Direct, one-to-one contact,</li>
  <li>&emsp;Without any Server in-between</li>
  <li>&emsp;Outside of any known communication channel (Skype, Viber etc)</li>
  <li>&emsp;Both orally and in writing</li>
  <li>&emsp;Without any call registration</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&emsp;The logic behind is quite simple: A common email account is used where each user’s device sends its public Internet IP address. All devices of the group having access to this mailbox can connect to each other with the use of a custom proprietary communication protocol.</p>
  <p>&emsp;No central server is used, so nobody except the two communicating parties knows that they are communicating. This makes cyphering unnecessary.</p>
  <p>&emsp;An email account can easily be created in Gmail, Yahoo etc. specifically for this application. Its login details are entered when the app runs for the first time and are stored in each user’s device only. The user’s normal email account is not influenced. The user’s telephone number is not used. No information about the user’s activity in the app is leaked anywhere.</p>
  <p>&emsp;The application runs both in iOS and Android devices. No similar application exists to my knowledge.</p>
