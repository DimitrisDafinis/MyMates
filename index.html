  <p>&emsp;This app targets small groups of users with the need to communicate with each other in absolute privacy.</p>

  <p>&emsp;Both orally and with short messages,</p>
  <p>&emsp;Directly, one-to-one,</p>
  <p>&emsp;Being anywhere in the world,</p>
  <p>&emsp;Outside of all known communication channels (Skype, Viber etc),</p>
  <p>&emsp;Avoiding any call registration.</p>

  <p>&emsp;The logic behind is quite simple: A common email account is used where each user’s device sends its public Internet address. All devices of the group having access to this mailbox can connect to each other with the use of a custom proprietary communication protocol.</p>

  <p>&emsp;An email account can easily be created in Gmail, Yahoo etc. specifically for this application. Its login details are entered when the app runs for the first time and are stored in each user’s device only. No information about the users’ activity is leaked anywhere else.</p>
    
  <p>&emsp;The application runs both in iOS and Android devices. It is not available in the public domain. There exists no other similar application to my knowledge.</p>    <p><a href="instructions.html">Instructions</a></p>
