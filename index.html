<p>&emsp;This app targets small groups of users (up to 7 people) in need for a direct, private and exclusive communication, one-to-one, outside of any public or private telecommunications provider.</p>

<p>&emsp;What is needed is just a common email account, shared by the members of the group.</p>

<p>&emsp;Its operation is simple: The app running on each user's device sends to the mailbox its public address as a common email message. This information is used by the apps of the other users to connect the apps together, so the users can talk directly.</p>

<p>Each user can be in any WiFi network in the world, or in any mobile network with data enabled.</p>
